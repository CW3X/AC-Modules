## SQL SUPPORT FILES

### This folder holds all supporting SQL files for the module. If your module includes additional data for the auth, characters, or world database they should be included here in their respective folder.

## Tips
- It's good practice to have a preceding **DELETE** statement for all **INSERT** statements. Cleaning the old data from the database is essential to avoid errors, control bloat, and keep systems happy.
- Large imports are best handled via batch files and the CLI.
- Templating can save you a lot of time and help you avoid errors. Create templates for commonly used structures.
- NaviCat and HeidiSQL are both excellent tools, but you might find some things work better with one or the other.
